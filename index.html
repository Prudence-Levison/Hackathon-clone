                    <p>We want our younger wowen toexplore different aspect of wha t it means to be an engineer in a fun hands in environment.Girls will learn leadership skills such as goal setting and efective communication and engage in activities that showcase different engineering activities. Participants will also design and create enginerring  projects through outthe week under the guidance of our engineering Mentors and Institutions</p>

                    <p>The aim is to arm young women who have a vested interest in science with the skills and confidence to pursue higher education and / or a career in STEM fields. At HackathonGirls, we recongnize that aceesing and particioating in STEM fields for women and girls is critical  to achieving gender equality.</p>

                    <h4>MATHEMATICS</h4>
                    <p> Poor participation of girls in mathematics isparticularly troubling as this isa gateway discipline to other fields. It is not only advantageous to have studied intermediate por advanced level mathematics at secondary schools, but in many cases it is requisite to tertiary study in STEM discipline, such as engineering and computing and we hope to organiz programms to encourage more girls to dotheir maths well.</p>
